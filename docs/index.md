# MkDocs Template
Welcome to the MkDocs Template Documentation.

This is nothing more than a basic page to start using MkDocs!

## Getting started
To start, clone the Repoitory (Click the "Use this template" button) and edit this file here.  
You can also just add new files and alter some settings.

More can be found on the [README.md](https://github.com/Andre601/mkdocs-template/blob/master/README.md)

## Manual Deploy
To manually deploy the sites from your local repository, use the `gh-deploy` command from MkDocs.  
Just make sure that you have set a GitHub repository in the `mkdocs.yml` to push towards.
