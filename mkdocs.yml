# |     As an example, setting "edit/master/docs/" as edit_uri while using                             |
# |     https://github.com/Andre601/mkdocs-template will result in the URL                             |
# |     https://github.com/Andre601/mkdocs-template/edit/master/docs/. Any page path will be appendet. |
# |     An absolute URL can also be defined by just providing the full URL (with http(s)://).          |
# |     For further customization (i.e. include file path in-between the edit path) use the            |

# |     DON'T SET THIS OPTION ALONGSIDE edit_uri. THEY ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.                         |
# |     Defines the path to the docs_dir in a repository which gets appended to the repo_url itself.   |
# |     This option uses Python format String with the following options being available:              |
# |       -  {path}      - The full path of a file relative to docs dir (i.e. foo/bar.md)              |
# |       - {path_noext} - Same as {path} but without the file extension (i.e. foo/bar)                |
# |     There is also a !q conversion flag available to percent-encode the path.                       |
# |     For example, {path!q} may return foo%2Fbar.md                                                  |

# |     Allows you to define the copyright of a site to be included by the theme.                      |
# |     Depending on how a theme handles this option will it be treated as HTML, meaning you have to   |
# |     consider cases of escaping certain content (i.e. < and >) and use specific shortcodes like     |
# |     &copy; for the copyright symbol.                                                               |

# |     The remote target branch used by MkDocs to push the built docs towards when using gh-deploy.   |
# |     For GitHub this usually should be gh-pages (The default).                                      |
# |     This option can be overriden by a command line option.                                         |

# |     String option that defines files and folders that should be included within the built docs,    |
# |     but not included within the navigation.                                                        |
# |     This can/should mainly be used if you include files not defined in the nav setting and don't   |
# |     want MkDocs to report these to you in the console.                                             |

# |     Allows you to define how strict MkDocs should be during link validations for certain types.    |
# |     Available options are "info", "warn" and "ignore".                                             |
# |     Behaviours can be set specifically for nav-related links (ommited, not found or abs. links)    |
# |     or for general links (not found, absolute links, unrecognized links).                          |
# |     You can also only add the option itself without it being nested to nav or links, to have it be |
# |     applied to both (Granted that this option exists in both, else only the one having it works).  |
# |     Please read the docs for full info on alla available options:                                  |

# |       - name:                      The name of the theme. MkDocs offers two built-in themes,       |
# |                                    MkDocs and ReadTheDocs.                                         |
# |                                    Other themes need to first be installed. You can use            |
# |                                    "mkdocs get-deps" to install them automatically. This requires  |
# |                                    them to be present in MkDocs Catalogue repository which can be  |
# |                                    found here:                                                     |

# |       - locale:                    Sets the site locale to be used. Whether the locale is          |
# |                                    supported by your theme depends on said theme.                  |
# |       - custom_dir:                Directory containing a custom theme. Can be a path relative to  |
# |                                    the configuration file, or an absolute path relative to the     |
# |                                    root of your local file system.                                 |
# |                                    This can also be used to extend and override the theme you're   |
# |                                    using by adding or overriding files, partials, etc.             |
# |       - static_template:           List of template files to render as a static page.              |
# |                                    File must be located either in the theme's template directory   |
# |                                    or the custom_dir directory.                                    |
# |       - <theme specific keywords>: Themes can add their own keywords to use in the configuration.  |
# |                                    Check your theme's documentation for more info.                 |
# |                                                                                                    |
# | - docs_dir                                                                                         |
# |     Defines the directory which holds the files to use for building the documentation.             |
# |     This can be a path relative to the configuration file, or an absolute path relative to your    |
# |     local file system.                                                                             |
# |     Also, MkDocs will include almost any file (with certain exceptions) from the docs dir unless   |
# |     they are prefixed with a dot (i.e. .something.md).                                             |
# |                                                                                                    |
# | - site_dir                                                                                         |
# |     Defines the directory where the built documentation should be put when using "mkdocs build".   |
# |     Just like docs_dir can this be a relative or absolute path.                                    |
# | - extra_css                                                                                        |
# |     Allows you to set a list of paths (relative to docs_dir) or URLs to CSS files that should be   |
# |     used by MkDocs.                                                                                |
# | - extra_javascript                                                                                 |
# |     Allows you to set a list of paths (relative to docs_dir) or URLs to Javascript files that      |
# |     should be used by MkDocs.                                                                      |
# |     Since v1.5 of MkDocs can you also define multiple config keys to define additional attributes, |
# |     namely:                                                                                        |
# |       - type: <string>                                                                             |
# |       - async: <boolean>                                                                           |
# |       - defer: <boolean>                                                                           |
# |                                                                                                    |
